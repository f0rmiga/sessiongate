# Session Gate

Session Gate is a Redis module to ease session management using tokens. This module does NOT do user
management, don't get confused. In the real world, most of the sessions are related to a user but do
your crazy logic to manage the users the way you want.

## How it works

This module provides creation and administration of sessions using tokens. Each session can have
more than one payload and those payloads can be accessed individually. A single instance of Redis
loaded with this module can handle sessions from multiple applications.

Redis is a high performance, in-memory data structure store. This module is built on top of it,
meaning this module operates in a very similar way Redis itself operates.

To access this module, any Redis compatible driver can be used. The commands to operate this module
are exposed like any other Redis command.

To know more about Redis modules, follow this [link](http://antirez.com/news/106).

## How to build

The module is written in C and uses Bazel to build. Bazel manages all the dependencies. :D

The dependencies are:

- [Redis Modules SDK](https://github.com/RedisLabs/RedisModulesSDK)
- [Sodium crypto library (libsodium)](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/)

### Building on Linux/OS X

Run:

```txt
bazel build //:sessiongate.so
```

### Building on Windows

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Building the Docker image

On Linux, Docker is necessary only if you want to load the built image into the daemon (which is
almost always the case). On OS X and Windows, Docker is always required to be installed.

On Linux, simply run `bazel run //:sessiongate_image`. It will build and load the image.

On OS X and Windows, run the script `./build_and_load_image_with_docker.sh`, which uses Docker in
Docker for building the module and appending it as a layer on top of the Redis image.

## How to run tests

Tests are located under `tests/` directory and are written in Python. You should have Python 2.7+
installed in order to run the tests. Run:

```txt
bazel test //...
```

For verbose tests run:

```txt
bazel test --test_output=all //...
```

## Loading the module for use

The module can be loaded in Redis 4+. The most convenient way to do that is by passing --loadmodule
parameter when starting the Redis server:

```txt
redis-server --loadmodule <path_to_sessiongate.so>
```

For example, starting Redis open to the world and the Session Gate loaded:

```txt
redis-server --protected-mode no --loadmodule $(pwd)/bazel-bin/sessiongate.so
```

Just make sure to pass the right `sessiongate.so` path value to the --loadmodule parameter.

## Commands

### Start a session

Command: `SESSIONGATE.START <sign_key> <ttl>`

- `<sign_key>` is the secret string used by the HMAC algorithm to generate the token signature.
- `<ttl>` is the positive integer that represents the seconds that the session will live. If set to
  0, the session expires immediately.

#### Example

```txt
SESSIONGATE.START 'qwerty' 300
```

Returns: a token that is used to manage the session.

### Set a session TTL

Command: `SESSIONGATE.EXPIRE <sign_key> <token> <ttl>`

- `<sign_key>` is the secret string used by the HMAC algorithm to verify the token signature.
- `<token>` is the token returned by the START command.
- `<ttl>` is the positive integer that represents the seconds that the session will live. If set to
  0, the session expires immediately.

#### Example

```txt
SESSIONGATE.EXPIRE 'qwerty' <token> 300
```

Returns: OK.

### Set a session payload

Command: `SESSIONGATE.PSET <sign_key> <token> <payload_name> <payload_data>`

- `<sign_key>` is the secret string used by the HMAC algorithm to verify the token signature.
- `<token>` is the token returned by the START command.
- `<payload_name>` is the payload name that is used to identify the payload data.
- `<payload_data>` is the payload data. It can be any string, for example, a JSON stringified
  object.

#### Example

```txt
SESSIONGATE.PSET 'qwerty' <token> 'user' '{"name":"John Doe"}'
```

Returns: OK.

### Get a session payload

Command: `SESSIONGATE.PGET <sign_key> <token> <payload_name>`

- `<sign_key>` is the secret string used by the HMAC algorithm to verify the token signature.
- `<token>` is the token returned by the START command.
- `<payload_name>` is the payload name that is used to retrieve the payload data.

#### Example

```txt
SESSIONGATE.PGET 'qwerty' <token> 'user'
```

Returns: a string containing the payload data.

### Delete a session payload

Command: `SESSIONGATE.PDEL <sign_key> <token> <payload_name>`

- `<sign_key>` is the secret string used by the HMAC algorithm to verify the token signature.
- `<token>` is the token returned by the START command.
- `<payload_name>` is the payload name that is used to identify the payload data being deleted.

#### Example

```txt
SESSIONGATE.PDEL 'qwerty' <token> 'user'
```

Returns: OK.

### End a session

Command: `SESSIONGATE.END <sign_key> <token>`

- `<sign_key>` is the secret string used by the HMAC algorithm to verify the token signature.
- `<token>` is the token returned by the START command.

#### Example

```txt
SESSIONGATE.END 'qwerty' <token>
```

Returns: OK.
